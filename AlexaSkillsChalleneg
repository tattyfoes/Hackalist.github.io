We're asking AWS Educate’s student community to think about the various challenges their peers face and the barriers to success in the academic setting. Working individually or in teams, AWS Educate student members will be challenged with the task of building Alexa skills that will address these challenges and help support students on the path to graduation.

Never built a skill? No problem. AWS Educate’s Alexa Badge goes over everything you need to know to build your first custom Amazon Alexa skill.

Build Alexa skills that fit into one of the following categories and use these examples for inspiration!

Student Life - Such as finding student-friendly establishments, finding student jobs and internships, staying healthy, reducing stress, getting enough sleep, financial planning, and more.
Learning - Such as study assistants, class scheduling, classroom experience improvements, interacting with teachers/ other students, mitigating procrastination, and more.
Community - Such as connecting with other students, keeping in touch with friends and family, raising awareness on social issues affecting students, discovering campus events, activities, resources, and more.
We can’t wait to see what you build!"
